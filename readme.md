## Preparing for a workshop

### Install node.js

Install node using the installer for your operating system found here: http://nodejs.org/download/

### Install javascripting and learnyounode

Install these two nodeschool workshops via the command-line:

```
npm install -g javascripting learnyounode
```

Check to make sure they are installed correctly. You should be able to run `javascripting` or `learnyounode` on the command-line and see a menu pop up that looks similar to this:

Install any that you might want to work on.

### Issues & troubleshooting

Having issues with installation? Let us know by opening an issue here: https://github.com/nodeschool/seattle/issues
Make sure to describe your problem in detail, including your operating system, what you used to install node, etc.

### Choose a text editor

If you've already got a text editor you like, then this is complete!

[Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/), [atom](http://atom.io), & [brackets](http://brackets.io/) are all good choices.

### Command-line basics

We'll be working through interactive tutorials that are completed on the command-line.

[Here are some basic commands that would be useful to learn about before the workshop](https://github.com/sethvincent/dev-envs-book/blob/master/chapters/04-terminal.md#basic-commands)

We'll be demoing how to complete the tutorials in the beginning of the workshop and will be available to help if there are any issues.
