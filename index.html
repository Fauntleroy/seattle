        <h1>Our first workshop: Dec. 13</h1>
        <p>Learn JavaScript & Node.js through self-paced interactive workshops!</p>

        <p>NodeSchool events have been held around the world, and successfully introduce beginners to JavaScript, Node, and the command-line. We're excited to bring NodeSchool to Seattle.</p>

        <p>You can do NodeSchool workshops from home, but the in-person workshops give you a chance to learn in a collaborative environment, & also to help other beginners if you already have JS/Node experience.</p>

        <p>Learn more about the international NodeSchool community at <a href="http://nodeschool.io">nodeschool.io</a></p>
